// OBJECTIVE: We have a list of cars, each with a price and model.
// We also will have a 'cash' variable that will determine if we can actually rent the car for that many days.
//* We will create a function where we pass the name of the car we want to rent and for how many days we want to rent it for.
//* How much money do we have? Is the car available and for how much a day? Can we afford it? How much cash would be leftover if we can afford it?
//* A FUNCTION NEEDS A UNIQUE NAME
//* NOW convert this program to use objects instead of arrays
